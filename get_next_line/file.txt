It seems like there might be a typo in your question, but if you're asking 
about the history of the "newline" character in computing, here's a brief overview:
The newline character, often represented as "\n" in programming languages, is used to signif
y the end of a line of text and the beginning of a new one. Its history can be trace
d back to the early days of teleprinters and typewriters.

In the context of teletypewriters (TTY) and early computers, 
the newline character served multiple purposes. One key function was to move the
 print head to the beginning of the next line so that subsequent
  characters would be printed on a new line
 . This concept was inherited from mechanical typewriters, where pressing
  the carriage return lever would move the paper to the next line.

As computing evolved, the newline character became a fundamental part
 of text representation in various operating systems and programming languages.
  Different systems adopted different conventions for newline characters, 
  leading to variations like "\n" (Unix and Linux), "\r\n" (Windows), and "\r" (older Mac systems).

The newline character plays a crucial role in text processing, file formats,
 and source code. Its consistent usage allows for better readability and interoperability between different systems and text editors.
